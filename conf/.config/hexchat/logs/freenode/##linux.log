Aug 20 02:19:34 <Dagmar>	zenix_2k2: If the SMART self-tests call foul, _then_ you have a broken drive.  If they _don't_ then you could have some other, more nefarious problem, like failing RAM
Aug 20 02:19:39 <zapotah>	its a conscious choice
Aug 20 02:19:48 <zenix_2k2>	Dagmar: so how can i run it ?
Aug 20 02:19:48 <pfred1>	Dagmar smart doesn't catch everything
Aug 20 02:19:50 *	PolluxZ has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
Aug 20 02:19:50 <gunix>	pfred1: what?
Aug 20 02:19:54 *	briner has quit (Quit: briner)
Aug 20 02:20:42 <Dagmar>	zenix_2k2: `smartctl -t short /dev/drivename` for starters, then `smartctl -a /dev/drivename` to see what it decided, and if that short test passed, then you run the -t long test (which may take several hours) and see if that passed
Aug 20 02:20:42 <zenix_2k2>	"everything" is too much, probably some vital stuffs is enough
Aug 20 02:20:51 <pfred1>	Dagmar a nefarious problem would be a dodgy PSU too
Aug 20 02:20:54 <zenix_2k2>	life is too short for everything in this case

Aug 20 02:21:08 <Dagmar>	pfred1: Except it's a better indicator of if the drive is failing than just "I have a corrupted filesystem":
Aug 20 02:21:17 *	[Awaxx] has quit (Quit: unmap'd that dirty pin.)
Aug 20 02:21:26 <pfred1>	Dagmar hmm smart is the wise choice
Aug 20 02:21:37 <pfred1>	full scan is best
Aug 20 02:21:44 <sauvin>	Any idiot can corrupt a filesystem.

Aug 20 02:21:55 <Dagmar>	Enh the short one generally takes like two minutes, so it doesn't hurt to start there
Aug 20 02:21:57 <pfred1>	sauvin we sure can!
Aug 20 02:21:59 *	nibble_zero has quit (Quit: nibble_zero)
Aug 20 02:22:04 <Dagmar>	It'll turn over problems with failing disk cache
Aug 20 02:22:17 <pfred1>	once I set the DMA mode wrong on a system don't do that
Aug 20 02:22:28 *	keepLearning512 has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Aug 20 02:22:34 <Dagmar>	The long test does a surface (non-destructive) test
Aug 20 02:22:41 <pfred1>	I thought for sure that system had udma6
Aug 20 02:22:41 <zapotah>	the thing about smart diag is that even if youve reallocated sectors, it will tell you its a pass
Aug 20 02:22:42 <zenix_2k2>	Dagmar: ok thk
Aug 20 02:22:43 <sauvin>	I once didn't appreciate the difference between a file HANDLE and a file POINTER while learning C. Trashed the filesystem.
Aug 20 02:22:47 *	KipperedSnack has quit (Quit: Meow.)
Aug 20 02:22:59 <Dagmar>	...and it tends to take "a while" on large, slow drives, since it reads each and every sector looking for CRC failures
Aug 20 02:23:08 <pfred1>	apparently it didn't
Aug 20 02:23:17 <Dagmar>	zapotah: SMART will tell you how many sectors have already been remapped
Aug 20 02:23:23 *	yohnnyjoe has quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
Aug 20 02:23:23 <zapotah>	Dagmar: yup
Aug 20 02:23:27 <Dagmar>	...or if they were recoverable.
Aug 20 02:23:28 *	fishfears (~whomstdun@70.39.109.197) has joined
Aug 20 02:23:29 <zapotah>	Dagmar: but it will not fail
Aug 20 02:23:40 <sauvin>	Dagmar, back in the DOS days as I remember it, BIOS would re-read a sector 32 times, I think it was, before reporting an error.
Aug 20 02:23:42 <pfred1>	smart will also map around bad sectors it finds
Aug 20 02:23:49 <Dagmar>	sauvin: Drives do all that themselves now
Aug 20 02:23:59 <pfred1>	ah I wouldn't bet on it
Aug 20 02:24:06 <sauvin>	Still with the mounting bad read counts before flagging?
Aug 20 02:24:07 <Dagmar>	pfred1: It has to be told to attempt to write to the pending uncorrectable sector before it will remap them
Aug 20 02:24:16 *	ninjakeks has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Aug 20 02:24:21 <Dagmar>	THat's where dd comes in
Aug 20 02:24:36 <pfred1>	there's where you accept that you're going to lose data
Aug 20 02:24:38 *	paulcarroty has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Aug 20 02:24:41 <sauvin>	Maybe I should have said "rising" rather than "mounting".
Aug 20 02:25:05 <Dagmar>	Well, you've already lost some data if anything came up as pending_uncorrectable
Aug 20 02:25:08 <SuperSeriousCat>	zenix_2k2, HDDs got like 3-5 years warranty. Just run SMART and check if it indeed is the HDD, and if it is you return it

Aug 20 02:25:22 *	KipperedSnack (~secured@buffer0verflow.com) has joined
Aug 20 02:25:30 <Dagmar>	Just having the SMART tests fail will generally get the manufacturer to cough up an RMA number
Aug 20 02:25:37 <sauvin>	Nuke it first if you don't want people knowing what your porn profile is like.
Aug 20 02:25:41 *	gdibass has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
Aug 20 02:25:48 <Dagmar>	(and yes, generally more than 60 remapped sectors will be beyond the warranty threshhold)
Aug 20 02:25:53 *	lin_noob (~lin_noob@unaffiliated/lin-noob/x-6934866) has joined
Aug 20 02:26:28 <Dagmar>	...but you can corrupt a filesystem just by killing the power during a write
Aug 20 02:26:46 *	Cthulu201 (~Cthulu201@unaffiliated/cthulu201) has joined
Aug 20 02:26:50 <Dagmar>	All the drive has to do is fail to complete writing a sector because the power went out, and *boom* it'll start failing that sector

Aug 20 02:27:18 <Dagmar>	It also will not ever do anything but cough up an error reading that particular sector until you've tried to rewrite it at least once
Aug 20 02:27:22 <pfred1>	she said a boom
Aug 20 02:27:28 <sauvin>	Makes a strong case for graceful shutdowns rather than just hitting the power switch.
Aug 20 02:27:48 <Dagmar>	A big case for buying a cheap UPS with a USB interface

Aug 20 02:28:13 <pfred1>	journal works here
Aug 20 02:28:16 <Dagmar>	Even the little single F2 battery models will keep a machine running long enough to gracefully shutdown if the power blinks out
Aug 20 02:28:17 *	itissid has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Aug 20 02:28:17 <lin_noob>	They should use capacitors inside the hard drive to protect against that.
Aug 20 02:28:23 *	awkwords has quit (Quit: sleepy time)
Aug 20 02:28:50 <Dagmar>	lin_noob: "Normal operating conditions" does not include 'random power failures", man

Aug 20 02:28:56 *	DannyDevOpsS (~DannyDevO@47.188.44.39) has joined
Aug 20 02:29:06 <sauvin>	I have the feeling a capacitor big enough to suit such a purpose isn't something you'd want going BOOM so close to the hard drive.
Aug 20 02:29:08 <lin_noob>	Power failures happen all the time
Aug 20 02:29:09 <pfred1>	Dagmar losing power is normal here

Aug 20 02:29:27 <lin_noob>	Or use RAID

Aug 20 02:29:59 <Dagmar>	Run without a UPS and you're pretty much going to lose some equipment in any ten-year span
Aug 20 02:30:07 *	xalen has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Aug 20 02:30:21 <pfred1>	in TN a lightning strike is when you get drunk on shine and trip over the power cord
Aug 20 02:30:33 <sauvin>	Naw, that's Alabama.
Aug 20 02:30:37 <Dagmar>	No, in TN a lightning strike tends to be "one of 10,000 that hit in the last two hours"
Aug 20 02:30:38 *	mandeep has quit (Client Quit)
Aug 20 02:30:46 <Dagmar>	We get _lots_ of lightning

Aug 20 02:31:38 <wyoung>	Dagmar: What does? the lack of genetic diversity?
Aug 20 02:31:43 <Dagmar>	Not everywhere regularly sees storms that will strike visibly in the neighborhood three to five times a minute
Aug 20 02:32:01 *	orbisvicis (~orbisvici@unaffiliated/orbisvicis) has left
Aug 20 02:32:12 <Dagmar>	It's part of hte reason the CoE have substations literally every few miles

Aug 20 02:32:44 <sauvin>	I seem to remember lightning in IL as being a lot worse when I was a kid. I rarely even *see* lightning anymore at all.

Aug 20 02:49:03 <pfred1>	spacedust yeah it doesn't really speed up loading programs
Aug 20 02:49:28 <pfred1>	I guess it helps compiling

Aug 20 02:49:34 <pfred1>	that does seem to have sped up
Aug 20 02:49:41 <darkmeson>	pfred1: in fairness though, an SSD *is* nice for bcache-like stuff
Aug 20 02:49:46 <spacedust>	pfred1: your 500GB has 200TBW endurance
Aug 20 02:49:54 <darkmeson>	especially if you've already maxed out on ram
Aug 20 02:50:02 <Bunk>	Umm, one question. I wanted to see sh files in a folder ls *.sh , but some sh files don't end with .sh - how can i display them anyway ?
Aug 20 02:50:19 <pfred1>	I only have 8 GB RAM
Aug 20 02:50:35 <pfred1>	I think this motherboard can handle 32GB?

Aug 20 02:51:02 <lin_noob>	8GB? Lol even phones have that much RAM now.
Aug 20 02:51:10 <Bunk>	Oh, thank you darkmeson
Aug 20 02:51:16 <lin_noob>	8GB would barely get you 2 tabs open in Chrome.
Aug 20 02:51:23 <pfred1>	lin_noob I use less than 2 GB
Aug 20 02:51:25 <spacedust>	pfred1: im using one of these now https://ark.intel.com/products/125020/Intel-SSD-545s-Series-256GB-2_5in-SATA-6Gbs-3D2-TLC its fairly decent i would say, but i never expected any program to start in picoseconds :) so maybe it just me

Aug 20 02:52:23 <pfred1>	lin_noob no

Aug 20 02:53:12 <darkmeson>	the stupid thing is that browsers STILL don't just save an intermediate form of a page
Aug 20 02:53:15 <lin_noob>	Well you're definitely not running Ubuntu or Mint with 2GB
